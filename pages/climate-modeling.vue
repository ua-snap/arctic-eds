        Assessments of climate&ndash;change effects in the Alaska are hindered
        by a lack of decision&ndash;support tools that can visualize possible
        future landscapes under different scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
        Model output products are publicly available, but often in formats
        requiring considerable expertise to access and process. Repackaging
        these outputs as climate reports moves relevant climate information out
        of storage and into decision&ndash;making spaces.

        What&rsquo;s changing in the Arctic?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Using climate data to envision how changes may progress in the
        near&ndash;term and more distant future is crucial for engineers,
        planners, and communities.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Warming temperatures</strong> are driving permafrost thaw and
          changes in heating degree days, cooling degree days, sea and river
          ice, glaciation, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Thawing of <strong>permafrost</strong> alters surface drainage and
          ground stability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes in <strong>precipitation</strong>, including shifts from snow
          to rain and altered frequency of extreme events can affect roads and
          structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Variables not directly linked to climate, such as daylight and tides,
          may be experienced differently in an altered climate.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These connections are complex, and the uncertainty associated with them
        is high. Nonetheless, by studying and modeling each factor and
        connecting model outputs when possible, we can produce a range of
        projections that explore possible changes locally, regionally, or
        landscape-wide across the North.

        Climate models help us imagine possible climate futures.
      </h3>
      <p>
        We use weather forecasts for short-term planning. Climate projections
        can be used for long&ndash;term planning&mdash;but they are not the same
        as forecasts. Weather varies day to day, whereas climate refers to the
        average or typical conditions over much longer time periods. However,
        there are uncertainties based on model limitations and unknown future
        human behavior that make long-range forecasting very different from
        predicting tomorrow's weather.
      </p>
      <p>
        Climate projections look much further into the future than weather
        forecasts. They address uncertainties by focusing on the range of future
        conditions that would likely occur, given what we currently know about
        the climate system and how it will change in response to changes in the
        factors that affect it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="how-projections-work" class="subtitle is-4">
        How do we make these projections? We use climate models.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Climate models are simplified versions of reality that try to explain
        climatic processes with just the most necessary parts of the system.
        Their usefulness is evident when we compare observed historical climate
        and simulated data&mdash;the models capture the most important climate
        patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Climate models use data to calculate how the global climate varies.
        These data include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>initial climate conditions</li>
        <li>
          &ldquo;forcings&rdquo; such as atmospheric greenhouse gas, solar and
          volcanic variability
        </li>
        <li>ocean and atmosphere variability</li>
        <li>land surface conditions</li>
        <li>feedbacks such as the carbon cycle and the water cycle</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The end product is a simulation of future climate. Because the end
        product is based on statistical probabilities, the data are most
        reliable when averaged across time or space, such as the projected
        average of 30 years of winter precipitation for your community, or the
        likely hottest temperature that might occur on the North Slope.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subtitle is-4">
        Climate models aren&rsquo;t perfect, though.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Between now and about 20&ndash;30 years from now, current climate change
        is the best predictor of the rate of change, but year to year
        variability is the largest source of uncertainty. Although long-term
        climate change shows clear trends, those can be masked by natural ups
        and downs in the short term. Climate models do simulate this kind of
        variability, but they cannot predict it precisely.
      </p>

      <h3 id="best-practices" class="subtitle is-4">
        Best practices for making projections
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Use multiple decades.</strong> Averages over 20&ndash;30 years
          are more resistant to transient variability in climate models and to
          natural variations in regional climate. Compare a future (like
          2030&ndash;2069) to a historical reference frame (like
          1970&ndash;1999), and keep in mind that the later the historical
          reference frame, the more climate change is already in it!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use multiple climate models.</strong> Picking one model is not
          good practice because all the models are at least plausible, if not
          equally likely. Use several separate models if the full range of
          possibilities is important to your work, or use the average of
          multiple models if you are more interested in the most likely outputs.
          This is especially critical between now and about the 2050s or 2060s.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use multiple emission scenarios.</strong> Given the
          uncertainty around future human behavior, you should pick at least two
          scenarios that bracket the likely range, unless you are only
          interested in looking at the &ldquo;best case&rdquo; or &ldquo;worst
          case&rdquo;. RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 are good choices.. This is especially
          critical after about 2050.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Look at medium&ndash;term and longer&ndash;term futures.</strong
          >
          A comprehensive assessment would consider a historical, a mid-21st
          century future, and a late&ndash;21<sup>st</sup> century future. The
          two futures should have a high, low and middle range each, possibly
          with multiple models and multiple emission scenarios in each future
          window.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Don&rsquo;t make your assessment area too small.</strong>
          The more local your assessment, the more likely it is that local
          factors like elevation, vegetation, etc. and the process used to
          downscale the climate model to local resolution contribute to the
          uncertainty. Larger areas are probably more resistant to this local
          variation, so a watershed, planning unit, or responses across several
          of these are perhaps more useful to consider.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >For fire projections and post-fire vegetation, look at averages
            across many model runs.</strong
          >
          The ALFRESCO fire and vegetation model cannot predict the precise
          behavior of future fires, but it can simulate the likelihood that
          fires will start and spread across broad landscapes across long
          periods of time, causing shifts in the age and type of vegetation.
          When looking at outputs, consider either a typical model run
          (&ldquo;best replicate&rdquo;) or an average of many possible burning
          scenarios. Outputs are helpful for assessing large&ndash;scale
          long&ndash;term shifts, but are not meaningful at a pixel by pixel
          level.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The future climate we experience will not look exactly like any of these
        projections, but it will look like a lot of them. There are a range of
        future climates we may experience, and best practices are to plan for
        the likely range of climates, impacts, and associated risks for the time
        frame and region you&rsquo;re planning for.

      <p>
        <strong
          >Projections are always improving incrementally. Don&rsquo;t wait for
          a better projection&mdash;you&rsquo;ll always be waiting and the costs
          of waiting will increase. In general, plan for the range of historical
          variability plus the range of climates described by a less warm (none
          show cooling!) climate model under a lower emissions scenario.</strong

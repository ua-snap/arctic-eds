          Assessments of climate&ndash;change effects in the Alaska are hindered
          by a lack of decision&ndash;support tools that can visualize possible
          future landscapes under different scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
          Model output products are publicly available, but often in formats
          requiring considerable expertise to access and process. Repackaging
          these outputs as climate reports moves relevant climate information
          out of storage and into decision&ndash;making spaces.
        </p>

          What&rsquo;s changing in the Arctic?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Using climate data to envision how changes may progress in the
          near&ndash;term and more distant future is crucial for engineers,
          planners, and communities.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Warming temperatures</strong> are driving permafrost thaw and changes in
            heating degree days, cooling degree days, sea and river ice,
            glaciation, and more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thawing of <strong>permafrost</strong> alters surface drainage and ground stability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changes in <strong>precipitation</strong>, including shifts from snow to rain and
            altered frequency of extreme events can affect roads and structures.
          </li>
          <li>
            Variables not directly linked to climate, such as daylight and
            tides, may be experienced differently in an altered climate.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These connections are complex, and the uncertainty associated with
          them is high. Nonetheless, by studying and modeling each factor and
          connecting model outputs when possible, we can produce a range of
          projections that explore possible changes locally, regionally, or
          landscape-wide across the North.

          Climate models help us imagine possible climate futures.
        </h3>
        <p>
          We use weather forecasts for short-term planning. Climate projections
          can be used for long&ndash;term planning&mdash;but they are not the
          same as forecasts. Weather varies day to day, whereas climate refers
          to the average or typical conditions over much longer time periods.
          However, there are uncertainties based on model limitations and
          unknown future human behavior that make long-range forecasting very
          different from predicting tomorrow's weather.
        </p>
        <p>
          Climate projections look much further into the future than weather
          forecasts. They address uncertainties by focusing on the range of
          future conditions that would likely occur, given what we currently
          know about the climate system and how it will change in response to
          changes in the factors that affect it.
        </p>

        <h3 id="how-projections-work" class="subtitle is-4">
          How do we make these projections? We use climate models.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Climate models are simplified versions of reality that try to explain
          climatic processes with just the most necessary parts of the system.
          Their usefulness is evident when we compare observed historical
          climate and simulated data&mdash;the models capture the most important
          climate patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Climate models use data to calculate how the global climate varies.
          These data include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>initial climate conditions</li>
          <li>
            &ldquo;forcings&rdquo; such as atmospheric greenhouse gas, solar and
            volcanic variability
          </li>
          <li>ocean and atmosphere variability</li>
          <li>land surface conditions</li>
          <li>feedbacks such as the carbon cycle and the water cycle</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The end product is a simulation of future climate. Because the end
          product is based on statistical probabilities, the data are most
          reliable when averaged across time or space, such as the projected
          average of 30 years of winter precipitation for your community, or the
          likely hottest temperature that might occur on the North Slope.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle is-4">
          Climate models aren&rsquo;t perfect, though.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Between now and about 20&ndash;30 years from now, current climate
          change is the best predictor of the rate of change, but year to year
          variability is the largest source of uncertainty. Although long-term
          climate change shows clear trends, those can be masked by natural ups
          and downs in the short term. Climate models do simulate this kind of
          variability, but they cannot predict it precisely.
        </p>

        <h3 id="best-practices" class="subtitle is-4">
          Best practices for making projections
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Use multiple decades.</strong> Averages over 20&ndash;30
            years are more resistant to transient variability in climate models
            and to natural variations in regional climate. Compare a future
            (like 2030&ndash;2069) to a historical reference frame (like
            1970&ndash;1999), and keep in mind that the later the historical
            reference frame, the more climate change is already in it!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use multiple climate models.</strong> Picking one model is
            not good practice because all the models are at least plausible, if
            not equally likely. Use several separate models if the full range of
            possibilities is important to your work, or use the average of
            multiple models if you are more interested in the most likely
            outputs. This is especially critical between now and about the 2050s
            or 2060s.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use multiple emission scenarios.</strong> Given the
            uncertainty around future human behavior, you should pick at least
            two scenarios that bracket the likely range, unless you are only
            interested in looking at the &ldquo;best case&rdquo; or &ldquo;worst
            case&rdquo;. RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 are good choices.. This is
            especially critical after about 2050.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Look at medium&ndash;term and longer&ndash;term futures.</strong
            >
            A comprehensive assessment would consider a historical, a mid-21st
            century future, and a late&ndash;21<sup>st</sup> century future. The
            two futures should have a high, low and middle range each, possibly
            with multiple models and multiple emission scenarios in each future
            window.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Don&rsquo;t make your assessment area too small.</strong>
            The more local your assessment, the more likely it is that local
            factors like elevation, vegetation, etc. and the process used to
            downscale the climate model to local resolution contribute to the
            uncertainty. Larger areas are probably more resistant to this local
            variation, so a watershed, planning unit, or responses across
            several of these are perhaps more useful to consider.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >For fire projections and post-fire vegetation, look at averages
              across many model runs.</strong
            >
            The ALFRESCO fire and vegetation model cannot predict the precise
            behavior of future fires, but it can simulate the likelihood that
            fires will start and spread across broad landscapes across long
            periods of time, causing shifts in the age and type of vegetation.
            When looking at outputs, consider either a typical model run
            (&ldquo;best replicate&rdquo;) or an average of many possible
            burning scenarios. Outputs are helpful for assessing
            large&ndash;scale long&ndash;term shifts, but are not meaningful at
            a pixel by pixel level.

          How will the &ldquo;real&rdquo; climate compare to any projection?
        </h3>

        <p>
          The future climate we experience will not look exactly like any of
          these projections, but it will look like a lot of them. There are a
          range of future climates we may experience, and best practices are to
          plan for the likely range of climates, impacts, and associated risks
          for the time frame and region you&rsquo;re planning for.

            historical variability plus the range of climates described by a
            less warm (none show cooling!) climate model under a lower emissions
            scenario.</strong

          About this tool
        </h2>
        <p>
          In the late 20th century the need for accessible environmental
          information, presented in a form useful for engineers and
          decision-makers, led to the publication of the Environmental Atlas of
          Alaska. A collection of the best data available at the time presented
          in lovely maps with accompanying text, the Atlas effectively provided
          an overview of physical aspects of the state. Well-organized plates
          cataloged the physical characteristics of the state alongside its
          waters, sunlight, and general climate. This was all paired with
          engineering requirements and guidelines, as well as a thorough
          bibliography.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title is-3">The Atlas ages</h2>
        <p>
          A product of its time, shortcomings with the Atlases became clear over
          time. A paucity of data frustrated engineers and planners not working
          along the road systems or rivers of the state, and presented
          particular challenges to engineers in the far north and west. Only
          average values were available in many locations. Complex topography,
          particularly in Southeast Alaska, also made coarse&ndash;scale maps
          frustratingly imprecise. Finally, the data was static, assuming a
          steady climatic state. Modern data tells a more detailed and different
          story&mdash;one of significant change.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title is-3">A path forward</h2>
        <p>
          Alaska&rsquo;s infrastructure must be robust to support the economic,
          defense, and social needs of a state experiencing a changing climate.
          The Arctic Environmental and Engineering Data &amp; Design Support
          System (Arctic EDS) provides easily obtainable, well&ndash;vetted, and
          reliable engineering and environmental data in a central location
          designed to meet the needs of engineering professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improved historical data allows this site to provide a more detailed
          picture of Alaska&rsquo;s climate history. Modern climate science also
          allows the Arctic EDS to make informed projections about the future of
          the stateâ€™s climate over the coming decades, on the scale of
          infrastructure lifespans of 50 to 80 years. Finally, modern engineers
          using computer&ndash;aided software programs will find the integration
          of functional modules, a data API, and python notebooks allow for easy
          integration of Arctic EDS data into engineering workflows.

          The tool, built by the team at the University of Alaska Fairbanks
          Scenarios Network for Alaska + Arctic Planning, is under active
          development. The Arctic EDS team comprises key performers from the
          University of Alaska Fairbanks&rsquo; International Arctic Research
          Center and Department of Civil, Geological, and Environmental
          Engineering; alongside experts from the University of Alaska
          Anchorage; the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory;
          Neptune, Inc.; and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

        <p>
          Funding comes from the Environmental Security Technology Certification
          Program, an environmental technology demonstration and validation
          program of the United States Department of Defense. The team is
          grateful for ongoing support and feedback from the United States Army
          Corps of Engineers.

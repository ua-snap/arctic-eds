          Physiography is the large-scale topography or landforms of an area.
          Alaska is divided into four major divisions from south to north: the
          Pacific Mountain System, the Intermontane Plateaus, the Rocky Mountain
          System, and the Interior Plains (Arctic Coastal Plain). All of these
          divisions are continuations of features of the western United States
          and Canada which extend into Alaska and bend to the west and even
          southwest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pacific Mountain System is a continuation of the Coastal Mountain
          System of the western United States and Canada. It consists of two
          arcs. The more northerly includes the Coast Mountains between
          southeastern Alaska and Canada, the Alaska Range, the Aleutian Range,
          and the Aleutian Islands. The southern arc consists of the island
          range of southeastern Alaska, the Fairweather Range, the St. Elias
          Mountains, the Kenai-Chugach Mountains and Kodiak Island. Between the
          two arcs is a trough composed of the Inland Passage, the Copper River
          Lowlands, the Cook Inlet-Susitna Lowlands and Shelikof Strait. This
          trough is broken by the Wrangell and Talkeetna Mountains.

          The Intermontane Plateaus are comparable to the area between the Rocky
          Mountains and the Coast Mountains in the 48 states and lie north and
          west of the Â·Alaska Range. They consist of dissected uplands, broad
          valleys, and lowland basins floored with alluvial deposits. The great
          river systems of the Yukon, Koyukuk, Porcupine, Tanana, and Kuskokwim
          Rivers flow through this area.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Brooks Range is the northern extension of the Rocky Mountain
          System which turns west as it reaches the Arctic Ocean near the
          Alaska-Canada border. These extremely rugged mountains reach to over
          9,000 feet in the east but are lower to the west. Glaciation during
          the Pleistocene carved this rugged landform, which persists with
          little change. The arctic foothills to the north consist of rolling
          plateaus and low mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Arctic Coastal Plain, an extension of the Great Plains, is a truly
          arctic region and consists of a broad level plain underlain with
          permafrost and pockmarked by thousands of shallow lakes and swamps.

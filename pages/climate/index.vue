              Physiography is the large-scale topography or landforms of an
              area. Alaska is divided into four major divisions from south to
              north: the Pacific Mountain System, the Intermontane Plateaus, the
              Rocky Mountain System, and the Interior Plains (Arctic Coastal
              Plain). All of these divisions are continuations of features of
              the western United States and Canada which extend into Alaska and
              bend to the west and even southwest.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Pacific Mountain System is a continuation of the Coastal
              Mountain System of the western United States and Canada. It
              consists of two arcs. The more northerly includes the Coast
              Mountains between southeastern Alaska and Canada, the Alaska
              Range, the Aleutian Range, and the Aleutian Islands. The southern
              arc consists of the island range of southeastern Alaska, the
              Fairweather Range, the St. Elias Mountains, the Kenai-Chugach
              Mountains and Kodiak Island. Between the two arcs is a trough
              composed of the Inland Passage, the Copper River Lowlands, the
              Cook Inlet-Susitna Lowlands and Shelikof Strait. This trough is
              broken by the Wrangell and Talkeetna Mountains.

              The Intermontane Plateaus are comparable to the area between the
              Rocky Mountains and the Coast Mountains in the 48 states and lie
              north and west of the Â·Alaska Range. They consist of dissected
              uplands, broad valleys, and lowland basins floored with alluvial
              deposits. The great river systems of the Yukon, Koyukuk,
              Porcupine, Tanana, and Kuskokwim Rivers flow through this area.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Brooks Range is the northern extension of the Rocky Mountain
              System which turns west as it reaches the Arctic Ocean near the
              Alaska-Canada border. These extremely rugged mountains reach to
              over 9,000 feet in the east but are lower to the west. Glaciation
              during the Pleistocene carved this rugged landform, which persists
              with little change. The arctic foothills to the north consist of
              rolling plateaus and low mountains.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Arctic Coastal Plain, an extension of the Great Plains, is a
              truly arctic region and consists of a broad level plain underlain
              with permafrost and pockmarked by thousands of shallow lakes and
              swamps.

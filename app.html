                Improving infrastructure resilience requires considering future
                climate conditions that may differ from the past. Historical
                observations are insufficient&mdash;the Arctic is warming four
                times faster than the rest of the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                High-resolution downscaled climate models provide valuable
                insights into localized climate futures of temperature,
                precipitation, and other environmental conditions such as
                permafrost, but their output introduces uncertainties to
                engineering applications. A systematic approach is needed to
                integrate future climate trends into engineering, including
                selecting appropriate models, understanding uncertainties, and
                addressing variable spatial and temporal scales.

                  The Arctic Environmental and Engineering Data and Design
                  Support System (Arctic-EDS) streamlines the process of using
                  downscaled climate models for engineering.
                </strong>
                The Arctic-EDS simplifies and centralizes the process of
                finding, selecting, extracting, and formatting downscaled
                climate model output: it pre-selects relevant models, simplifies
                data extraction, and provides reports with future projections of
                climate variables and indices. Data is available for download in
                a tabular format, with links to source datasets and academic
                references. Example computational notebooks demonstrate how to
                apply the data to engineering applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                All downscaled climate model outputs are vulnerable to various
                sources of uncertainty, including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Natural climate variability</li>
                <li>
                  Limited historical climate station data from which to
                  interpolate gridded baseline datasets and validate modeled
                  gridded data
                </li>
                <li>Model assumptions and parameterizations</li>
                <li>
                  Uncertainty regarding future societal and economic behaviors
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spatial and temporal resolutions of downscaled climate data
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The Arctic-EDS regulates these uncertainties by:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Presenting gridded data from multiple climate models and
                  emissions scenarios
                </li>
                <li>Stating spatial and temporal scales of each dataset</li>
                <li>Presenting bias-corrected data</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                No climate model or data processing technique can entirely
                eliminate uncertainty, but the Arctic-EDS unlocks data that
                shows how future climate conditions might differ from the past.
                Each engineering application may require additional steps to
                interpret results and apply them to a specific design.
